Better choices based on weather which is scientifically proven to effect our mood. 
Less time choosing a meal equals more time creating cherished memories with your loved ones.

How it works: 
 1. When the page loads it asks for user's permission to share current location.
 2. If the user allows to share current location a weather card shows up with reccomendation
    eg: If its raining then get delivery or soup.
 3. Based on the recomendation users can select a category and enter their location and get search results
 4. Search results are coming from Zomato (Yelp of India)
 5. Zomato provides services in USA, India, UK, Brazil, UAE and 18 other countries. So our application will work in all of those countries.
 6. Results are sorted by rating, provide information such as Outdoor seating, cost for 2, address, menu and website
